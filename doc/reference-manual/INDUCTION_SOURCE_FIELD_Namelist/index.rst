INDUCTION_SOURCE_FIELD Namelist
===============================

The INDUCTION_SOURCE_FIELD namelist defines the external magnetic field that
serves as the applied source in the computation of Joule heat for induction
heating simulations. The field is a continuous wave (CW) function with
frequency :math:`f` of the form

.. math::
   \vec{H}_\text{ext}(\tau,\mathbf{x}) = \sin(2\pi f\tau)\,\vec{h}(\mathbf{x}),
   \quad\text{where}\quad
   \vec{h}(\mathbf{x}) = A\hat{e} + \sum_{i=1}^{m}\vec{h}_i(\mathbf{x})

is the superposition of a uniform field of strength :math:`A` oriented in
the unit direction :math:`\hat{e}`, and the magnetic fields :math:`\vec{h}_i`
generated by a collection of induction coils with electric currents :math:`c_i`.

Besides a steady CW source that is used for an entire induction heating
simulation, a CW source that changes abruptly at a sequence of heat transfer
times :math:`t_1,\ldots,t_n` may be defined by specifying addtional values
for the source parameters (:math:`f`, :math:`A`, and :math:`c_i`) to use at
those times.

Namelist Variables
------------------

.. contents::
   :local:

orientation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The orientation :math:`\hat{e}` of the uniform field. For simplicity this
is currently restricted to one of the coordinates axes, :math:`\hat{x}`,
:math:`\hat{y}`, or :math:`\hat{z}`. This value also defines the orientation
of the induction coil axes.

:Type: string
:Default: `"z"`
:Valid Values: `"x"`, `"y"`, or `"z"`

.. _EM_ST:

times
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An optional list of one or more heat transfer times :math:`t_1<\ldots<t_n`
when the CW source field changes.

:Type: real
:Default: none
:Valid Values: any strictly increasing sequence
:Notes: When this is specified, corresponding lists of values must also be
        specified for `frequency`_, `uniform_strength`_, and the
        :ref:`current<coil_current>` component of each coil defined by
        `coils`_. The number of values in those lists must be one more
        than the number of values specified here.

.. _EM_SF:

frequency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The frequency :math:`f` (cycles per unit time) of the sinusoidally-varying
source field. When `times`_ is specified, additional values to use at each
of those times must also be specified.

:Type: real
:Default: none
:Valid Values: any sequence of one or more postive values

.. _EM_US:

uniform_strength
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The strength :math:`A` of the uniform source field. The field is oriented
in the direction specified by `orientation`_. When `times`_ is specified,
additional values to use at each of those times must also be specified.

:Type: real
:Default: 0
:Valid Values: any sequence of one or more values
:Notes: A negative value essentially shifts the phase by 180 degrees.

        For reference, the magnitude of the magnetic field within an
        infinitely-long, finely-wound coil with linear current density
        :math:`I` is simply :math:`I`. The field magnitude at the center
        of a circular current loop of radius :math:`r` with current
        :math:`I` is :math:`I/{2r}`. In both cases the field is directed
        along the axis of the coil/loop.


coils
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Optional data that defines the geometry and current of one or more induction
coils. :numref:`Figure %s<fig_coil_schematic>` shows the idealized model of
a coil that is used to analytically evaluate the magnetic field it generates.
This parameter is a structure array. Each element defines a coil and consists
of the following components. Note that the axis orientation is defined
by the `orientation`_ parameter above and is common to all coils.

   * - Component
     - Description
   * - **%num_loops**
     - The number of current loops.
   * - **%radius**
     - The radius :math:`r>0` of the coil loops.
   * - **%length**
     - The length :math:`l>0` of the coil. This is only required when the
       number of coil loops is greater than 1.
   * - **%center**
     - A 3-vector giving the position of the center :math:`x_0` of the coil;
       the default is `0, 0, 0`.
   * -
       .. _coil_current:
       **%current**
     - The amplitude :math:`c_i` of the sinusoidally-varying current in each
       coil loop. A negative value essentially shifts the phase by 180 degrees.
       When `times`_ is specified, additional values to use at each of those
       times must also be specified.
