PHYSICS Namelist
==================

Overview
-----------

The PHYSICS namelist specifies which physics models are active in the simulation. The models are implemented by the four primary physics kernels — fluid flow, heat/species transport, induction heating, and solid mechanics — which are weakly coupled using time splitting. A brief overview of the physics kernels follows; see Truchas Physics and Algorithms for more details.

**Fluid Flow**. The fluid flow physics model simulates multi-material, incompressible flow with interface tracking. A gravitational body force is defined using the :ref:`Body_Force_Density<PHYSICS_BFD>` variable. See the :ref:`MATERIAL<MATERIAL_and_PHASE_Namelists>` namelist for a description of the material properties required by the fluid flow model.

**Heat and Species Transport**.  The heat and species transport physics kernel models both heat conduction with thermal (view factor) radiation, and solutal species diffusion and thermodiffusion. These (primarily) diffusive transport processes are fully coupled; advection of enthalpy and solutal species are handled by the fluid flow physics kernel and incorporated as loosely-coupled source terms. Heat transport is enabled using the :ref:`Heat_Transport<PHYSICS_HT>` flag, and solves the heat equation

.. math::
  \frac{\partial H}{\partial T} = \Delta . K \Delta T + Q + Q_{joule} + Q_{adv} 
 :label: eq_ht

with dependent variables temperature :math:`T` and enthalpy density :math:`H`. The enthalpy density is algebraically related to temperature as :math:`H=f(T)` where :math:`f′(T) =\rho c_p`is the volumetric heat capacity. See the :ref:`MATERIAL<MATERIAL_and_PHASE_Namelists>` namelist for a description of the material properties required by the heat equation. The optional volumetric heat source :math:`Q` is defined through the :ref:`DS_SOURCE<DS_SOURCE_Namelist>` namelist using "temperature" as the equation name. The Joule heating source :math:`Q_{joule}` is computed by the induction heating kernel, and the advected heat :math:`Q_{adv}` by the flow kernel. The boundary conditions on :math:`T` are defined through the :ref:`THERMAL_BC<THERMAL_BC_Namelist>` namelists. The initial value of :math:`T` are defined through the Temperature variable of the :ref:`BODY<BODY_Namelist>` namelists. View factor radiation systems which couple to the heat equation are defined using :ref:`ENCLOSURE_RADIATION<ENCLOSURE_RADIATION_Namelist>` namelists. Solutal species transport is enabled using the :ref:`Species_Transport<PHYSICS_ST>` flag, which solves the :math:`n` coupled equations

.. math::
  \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial t} = \Delta . D_i (\Delta \phi_i[+S_i\Delta T]) + Q_i + Q_{{i},{adv}} 
 :label: eq_st

for species concentrations :math:`\phi_i`. The number of components :math:`n` is defined by :ref:`Number_of_Species <PHYSICS_NOS>`. The thermodiffusion term in [·] is only included when coupled with heat transport. See the :ref:`MATERIAL<MATERIAL_and_PHASE_Namelists>` namelist for defining the diffusivities :math:`D_i` and Soret coefficients :math:`S_i`. The optional volumetric source :math:`Q_i` is defined through the :ref:`DS_SOURCE<DS_SOURCE_Namelist>` namelist using "concentration i" as the equation name. The advected species source :math:`Q_{i,adv}` is computed by the flow kernel. Boundary conditions on :math:`\phi_i` are defined through the :ref:`SPECIES_BC<SPECIES_BC_Namelist>` namelists. The initial value of the :math:`\phi_i` are defined through the :ref:`Phi<B_phi>` variable of the :ref:`BODY<BODY_Namelist>` namelists.

**Induction Heating**.  The induction heating physics kernel solves for the Joule heat that is used as a source in heat transport. It is enabled using the :ref:`Electromagnetics<PHYSICS_EM>` flag. See the :ref:`MATERIAL<MATERIAL_and_PHASE_Namelists>` namelist for a description of the material properties required by the electromagnetics solver. The :ref:`Electromagnetics<PHYSICS_EM>` namelist is used to describe the induction heating problem.

**Solid Mechanics**.  The solid mechanics physics kernel models small strain
elastic deformation of solid material phases, including deformations induced
by temperature changes. It is enabled using the `Solid_Mechanics`_ flag. See
the :ref:`MATERIAL<MATERIAL_and_PHASE_Namelists>` namelist for a description
of the material properties required by the solid mechanics kernel.
Displacement and traction boundary conditions are defined using
:ref:`SM_BC<SM_BC_Namelist>` namelists. A gravitational body force may be
defined using the `Body_Force_Density`_ variable. Parameters which define
the plasticity model are defined using the
:ref:`VISCOPLASTIC_MODEL<VISCOPLASTIC_MODEL_Namelist>` namelist.
