Introduction
===============
In this Users Manual we describe and demonstrate the capabilities of `TRUCHAS <https://www.truchas.org/>`_. We begin with a simple
conductive heat transfer problem and progress to problems involving phase change, fluid flow, radiative heat
transfer, chemical reactions, solid deformation, and electromagnetics. Further chapters explain how to run 
TRUCHAS in parallel on a cluster, how to obtain the different kinds of output that TRUCHAS can generate,
and some of the limitations, sensitivities, and uncertainties a user may confront in executing TRUCHAS.
