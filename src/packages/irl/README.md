# Interface Reconstruction Library (IRL)
Welcome to the Interface Reconstruction Library (IRL). This library contains functions for computational geometry and interface reconstruction methods used to represent immiscible interfaces in geometric Volume of Fluid computational fluid dynamics simulations of multiphase flows. In general, this library can be helpful whenever planes are used to represent an interface between two objects. Currently, the computational geometry routines focus on calculating the volumetric moments for tetrahedron and hexahedron that lay on each side of a (potentially intersecting) set of planes. In the future, greater functionality will be added, so if there is something you believe would be helpful to add, please let me know.


IRL is written in C++14 with a Fortran 2003 interface. Below are links to additional information on how to install and use IRL:
