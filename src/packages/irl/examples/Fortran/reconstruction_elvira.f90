! In this example, the ELVIRA
! reconstruction method implemented inside
! IRL will be demonstrated. First, a PlanarSeparator
! will be directly specified and used to obtain
! SeperatedVolumeMoments for a 3x3 stencil. This will
! then be used to perform a ELVIRA reconstruction
! using the liquid volume fraction.

! The calculated interface is then shown to
! directly recover the planar interface
! that created the original volume fraction field.
! While this is shown for 2D, the exact same process
! can be done for 3D, adding a total of 27 members
! to the ELVIRANeighborhood instead of 9 (because of
! the change in stencil size).
