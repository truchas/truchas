The files in this directory contain the information needed to generate some of the 
polyhedron used in IRL_root/src/geometty/polyhedrons/ using the polyhedron_creator tool.

The file containing the simplex information must be formatted as followed
name_of_file (newline)
NameOfPolyhedronClass (newline)
List of vertex indices making up the faces.

To adhere with conventions used in IRL, the
file name should be lower-case and separated by
underscores, such as rectangular_cuboid.
The polyhedron class name should have no spaces
or underscores and start each new word with a capital letter,
such as RectangularCuboid.

An example of such an input file would be this, used to generate
a RectangularCuboid class.
