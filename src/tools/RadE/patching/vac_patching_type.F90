!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! VAC_PATCHING and PAVE_PATCHING are extensions of the abstract base class
!! PATCHING.  See the base class comments for a description of the common type
!! bound procedures.  Since the parameters of each algorithm are nearly
!! identical, we only list them once, and highlight any differences.  Details
!! specific to each algorithm are discussed in the IMPLEMENTATION NOTES section
!! below.
!!
!!   INIT(E, PARAMS, STAT, ERRMSG) initializes the object.  The ENCL object E is
!!     the radiation enclosure.  The PARAMETER_LIST object PARAMS contains all
!!     other parameters needed to initialize the object.  If an error is
!!     encountered, STAT returns a non-zero value and ERRMSG an explanatory
!!     message.  The following parameters are recognized:
!!
!!       max-angle -- maximum allowable angle in degrees between normals of
!!           adjacent faces.  If two topologically adjacent faces are at an
!!           angle greater than max-angle degrees, they will not be considered
!!           adjacent during patch construction.
!!       verbosity-level -- specifies the verbosity level of messages printed by
!!           the object.  A verbosity level <= 0 suppresses all output.
!!       merge-level -- controls the aggressiveness of patch merging.  A merge
!!           level of 0 indicates no merging.  A merge level >= 3 indicates the
!!           most aggressive merging method.
!!       split-patch-size -- maximum size of patches that are 'split' into
!!           1-face patches during patch merging.  Actually, we queue these
!!           1-face patches along with the original patch.  The 1-face patches
!!           have a large weight, and are only used to 'fill-in the gaps' after
!!           merging.
!!       random-seed -- optional parameter. Only recognized by PAVE. If present,
!!           it is used to initialize the random number generator used to pick
!!           the initial seed patches.  If not present, the seed is taken from
!!           the system clock.
!!
!!
!!  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
!!
!!  1. These algorithms are based on the idea that the set of all faces sharing a
!!  particular vertex (called the faces of a vertex) tend to form patches with
!!  desirable properties.  Such patches are connected, relatively small, and tend
!!  to be roughly circular.  These patches have an associated 'vertex anchor',
!!  namely the vertex shared by all their faces.  We use the term 'full patches'
!!  to refer to patches consisting of all the faces of their vertex anchor.
!!  'Partial patches', as expected, refer to patches whose faces are a strict
!!  subset of the faces of their vertex anchor.  These algorithms attempt to
!!  maximize the number of full patches generated.
!!
!!  2. VAC_PATCHING: In the VAC algorithm, we iterate through each node and add
!!  its corresponding full patch to a global priority queue.  We then pop the
!!  queue entries one by one until the queue is empty.  If all the faces of a
!!  queue entry are unassigned, we create a new patch from the entry.  Otherwise,
!!  we make a new entry from the subset of faces of the original entry that are
!!  still unassigned, and add the entry to the queue.  When the queue is empty,
!!  we have a valid patching of the enclosure.  Finally, we merge patches where
!!  possible, in accordance with the MERGE_LEVEL parameter
!!
!!  3. PAVE_PATCHING: The PAVE algorithm is very similar to VAC, with one key
!!  difference.  Instead of queueing all the nodes at the beginning, we instead
!!  queue a seed patch in each connected component of the enclosure.  When we pop
!!  an entry from the queue, we add new entries for each of the 1st and 2nd
!!  degree neighbors of the entry's vertex anchor.  This process continues until
!!  the queue is empty.  In this way, we 'pave' each component with full patches,
!!  starting from the component seeds.  For better results, the component seeds
!!  are chosen to be on the corners or edges of the component, if they exist.
