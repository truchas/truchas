!! This module provides the mesh modification subroutine ADD_GAP_ELEMENTS
!! used by the utility program addgaps.  This version of the module implements
!! a completely new algorithm for adding the gap elements that is more robust
!! and general than the algorithm used in the preceding version.

 !! ADD_GAP_ELEMENTS
 !!
 !! This subroutine adds gap elements to the input mesh INMESH returning the
 !! resulting mesh in OUTMESH.  The gap elements are inserted along the mesh
 !! surfaces described by the side sets whose IDs are given in the list SSID.
 !!
 !! The routine first identifies the active part of the input mesh, and
 !! generates the necessary data for it.  This data is then used to transform
 !! the input mesh to the output mesh containing gap elements.
 !!
 !! Some terminology used throughout the comments.  An active (or gap) node is
 !! a node on one of the gap surfaces.  An element is an active element if it
 !! contains an active node, and a side of an active element is an active side
 !! if the side contains an active node.  An active side is a gap side if it,
 !! or its neighbors corresponding side, was specified by one of the gap side
 !! sets.  The collection of all the active elements forms the active submesh;
 !! all other elements and all inactive sides and nodes can be ignored as they
 !! are not involved in the process of inserting gap elements.

 !! GENERATE_NEIGHBOR_DATA
 !!
 !! This subroutine generates the neighbor data arrays JNBR and KNBR for the
 !! active subset of the input mesh.  When positive, JNBR(K,J) is the index of
 !! the active element that neighbors active element J across local side K, and
 !! KNBR(K,J) is the corresponding local side index of the neighbor.  Boundary
 !! sides are indicated by a zero JNBR value, and inactive/nonexistent sides
 !! to be ignored are indicated by a negative JNBR value.  These arrays
 !! satisfy the reciprocity relations
 !!
 !!      JJ = JNBR(K,J)>0,    J = JNBR(KK,JJ)>0,
 !!      KK = KNBR(K,J),      K = KNBR(KK,JJ).
 !!
 !! The identification of neighbors is accomplished by first binning up the
 !! active sides according to a hash of the nodes on a side.  Once this data
 !! structure has been created, neighbors can be found by a quick search of
 !! a (very) small bin.
 !!
 !! We implicitly assume that the incoming mesh has a valid topology and do
 !! not make the effort here that we could/should to verify a good topology.

 !! GENERATE_GSIDE_DATA
 !!
 !! This subroutine generates the GSIDE array which identifies the gap sides
 !! and other active sides of active elements.  When positive, GSIDE(K,J) is
 !! the index of the side set that specified side K of active element J as a
 !! gap side.  GSIDE = 0 for remaining active, non-gap sides.  GSIDE is
 !! negative for inactive or nonexistent sides.  The array satisfies the
 !! reciprocity relation
 !!
 !!   GSIDE(K,J) = GSIDE(KK,JJ) when KK = KNBR(K,J), JJ = JNBR(K,J) > 0.
 !!
 !! This means that adjacent elements have the same GSIDE value for their
 !! shared side.
 !!
 !! Each 'side' in a side set is an element/local-side pair.  The side sets
 !! that specify the gap surface may be one-sided (elements from one side of
 !! the surface), two-sided (elements from both sides of the surface), or
 !! something in between.  It is desirable in the output mesh, however, for
 !! a side set to include 'sides' from both sides of the gap it specified.
 !! This subroutine returns the XSIDE/SIDE arrays that contain any sides
 !! that were missing from the input mesh side set and that should be added
 !! to the output mesh side set.  SIDE(I,XSIDE(N):XSIDE(N+1)-1) are the
 !! missing elements (I=1) and corresponding local sides (I=2) that should

 !! DEFINE_EBLK
 !!
 !! This subroutine defines the element blocks in OUTMESH, adding blocks of
 !! gap elements to the element blocks from INMESH.  The bulk of the mesh
 !! transformation work is done here.
 !!
 !! The fundamental algorithm is simple:
 !!
 !! 1. Each active node of each active element is replaced by a new node.
 !!    This slices the mesh open along all active faces.
 !! 2. A 0-width gap element is inserted between neighboring elements across
 !!    a gap side.  This reconnects the mesh on gap sides.
 !! 3. On the remaining active sides, which are still sliced open, we identify
 !!    matching nodes from either side, and declare them to be equivalent.
 !!    This reconnects the neighbors, repairing the damage done in step 1.
 !!
 !! One virtue of this algorithm is that we don't need to determine a priori
 !! how many daughter nodes a gap node needs to be split into; this happens
 !! automatically during step 3.
 !!
 !! In practice, the algorithm is complicated by the element block structure
 !! of the Exodus mesh, the differing type of gap elements that can arise,
 !! and the need to place the gap elements that are created into specific
 !! element blocks, depending on element type and side set.
 !!
 !! In order to define the OUTMESH element blocks, this subroutine creates
 !! two or more coincident daughter nodes for each gap node.  The relationship
 !! between a gap node and its daughters is described by the returned DAUGHTER
 !! array.  When J <= INMESH%NUM_NODE, DAUGHTER(J)>0 identifies node J as a gap
 !! node.  Its first daughter replaces it as node J, and its next daughter is
 !! node DAUGHTER(J).  The complete set of daughter nodes is obtained by walking
 !! down the linked-list structure until a zero DAUGHTER value is encountered.
 !! All the daughters after the first are new nodes, and are numbered after
 !! the nodes in the input mesh.  DAUGHTER(J)=0 for all original inactive nodes;
 !! these nodes retain their number in the output mesh.
