!! NNC, 2 May 2012.  As part of removing old HT, the HEAT_CONDUCTION flag needed
!! to be moved somewhere.  Ultimately we want a "multi-process coordinator" that
!! is responsible for bundling together the various process kernels and managing
!! their interaction.  This flag belongs there; this is its _temporary_ home.
!!
!! Originally the HEAT_CONDUCTION flag was specific to the old solver, now it
!! refers to the new solver.
