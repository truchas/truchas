!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! This module defines the TIME_STEP_SYNC derived type.  It has a single type
!! bound function:
!!
!!  NEXT_TIME(TSTAR, T0, H0, H1) returns the time T1 for the next step.  TSTAR
!!    is the target time; T0 is the time of the current step, T0 < TSTAR; H0 is
!!    the last time step size; and, H1 is the next proposed time step size.
!!    All arguments are intent-in.  Nominally the returned value for T1 would
!!    be T0 + H1, however the function returns an adjusted time whenever the
!!    current time is within range of the target time.  When used consecutively
!!    to define the time for the next step, the function ensures that the
!!    target time is hit precisely while keeping the ratio of consecutive step
!!    sizes close to one.  The resulting step size will never exceed H1 in any
!!    event.  How gradually the step sizes are adjusted depends on how far in
!!    advance of the target time the times are adjusted. This is the look-ahead
!!    range, which is measured in terms of the number of steps given a current
!!    step size.  Note that the function does not modify H1; if the returned
!!    T1 is used for the next step, then H1 should be overwritten with T1 - T0.
!!
!! A variable of this type is initialized by assignment from a structure
!! constructor.  The constructor TIME_STEP_SYNC(N) returns an object with
!! look-ahead range set to N steps.
!!
!! NB: NEXT_TIME is carefully implemented so that it will return precisely
!! the target value TSTAR when intended and not merely something very close
!! (within a few ulps, for example).  As a result it is entirely proper to
!! use '==' when comparing the result to TSTAR.
!!
!! To give a feel for the behavior as a function of the range N, consider an
!! extreme example with a step size H and TSTAR - T0 = (N-1)*H + epsilon.
!! In other words step N-1 would fall just shy of the target time by a small
!! amount and so require N steps to reach TSTAR.  The function will reduce
!! the effective step size by a factor R<1 each step so that TSTAR is reached
!! in N steps.  Here are the values of R for various ranges.  Note that if
!! step N-1 misses TSTAR by a wider margin the associated R is closer to 1.
!!
!!     N |  R
!!   ----+------
!!     1 | 0.00
!!     2 | 0.50
!!     3 | 0.62
!!     4 | 0.81
!!     5 | 0.89
!!     6 | 0.93
!!     7 | 0.95
!!     8 | 0.96
!!     9 | 0.97
!!    10 | 0.98
!!
!! The result for N=1, effectively no look-ahead, is indicative of the bad
!! thing that can happen in the naive approach of simply cutting the step size
!! at the last moment so that TSTAR is not passed -- the time step can be
!! arbitrarily small.
