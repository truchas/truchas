!! OUTPUT_CONTROL
!!
!! This module was created to hold the variables from OUTPUT_DATA_MODULE and
!! OUTPUT_MODULE that control when the solution was output.  Everything else
!! in those modules is tied to TBrook and they are slated for deletion when
!! TBrook is ultimately deleted from the code.  I expect this module to exist
!! only temporarily until the control of output is refactored/reimplemented.
