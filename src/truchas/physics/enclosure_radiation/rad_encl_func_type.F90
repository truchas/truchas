!! RAD_ENCL_FUNC_TYPE
!!
!! Neil N. Carlson <nnc@lanl.gov>, 5 Apr 2010
!!
!! This module provides a derived type for describing scalar, face-based
!! surface data that depends on time.  An instance of this type should be
!! viewed as the discretization of a time-space function over the faces
!! of a distributed enclosure surface mesh.
!!
!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! The derived type ENCL_FUNC is an opaque structure with private
!! components.  No defined assignment is provided; do not use instances of
!! this type in an assignment statement unless you really know what default
!! assignment does (it's almost certainly not what you want in this case).
!! The enclosure surface data is defined by an initial call to EF_PREP
!! followed by one or more calls to EF_ADD_FUNCTION and a final call to
!! EF_DONE.  This definition phase is mandatory.  At this point the object
!! may be evaluated using EF_EVAL.
!!
!!  CALL EF_PREP (THIS, ENCL) prepares the ENCL_FUNC object THIS to begin
!!    receiving the data functions to be associated with groups of enclosure
!!    surface faces.  ENCL is a pointer to the distributed enclosure mesh
!!    object over which the boundary condition applies.  The implementation
!!    assumes that the enclosure surface is never modified.
!!
!!  CALL EF_ADD_FUNCTION (THIS, F, BLOCKID, STAT, ERRMSG) associates the
!!    SCAFUN function object F to the group of surface faces that belong to
!!    a block with an ID from the list given by rank-1 integer array BLOCKID.
!!    The possible blocks are those defined in ENCL.  The function object
!!    should expect (/ t, x, y, z /) as the array argument.  An independent
!!    copy of F is stored so that the actual argument may be destroyed
!!    afterwards if desired.  A nonzero value is assigned to the integer STAT
!!    if an error condition occurs, and an explanatory message is assigned to
!!    the character string ERRMSG.  Possible errors are referring to an invalid
!!    block ID or attempting to associate a face to more than one function.
!!    This routine may be called multiple times as long as the specified face
!!    blocks do not overlap from one call to the next.
!!
!!  CALL EF_DONE (THIS, STAT, ERRMSG) performs the final configuration of the
!!    ENCL_FUNC object THIS after all the desired calls to EF_ADD_FUNCTION
!!    have been made.  A nonzero value is assigned to the integer STAT if an
!!    error condition occurs, and an explanatory error message is assigned to
!!    the character string ERRMSG.  It is an error for a surface face to not be
!!    associated with a function.  After this call the object THIS may be
!!    evaluated using EF_EVAL.
!!
!!  CALL EF_EVAL (THIS, T, VALUE) evaluates the ENCL_FUNC object THIS at
!!    the time T and returns the computed data values in the face-based array
!!    VALUE.  A simple 1-point (face centroid) quadrature is currently used for
!!    functions that are spatially dependent.
!!
!!  CALL EF_DESTROY (THIS) frees the resources belonging to the ENCL_FUNC
!!    object THIS, returning it to its default initialization state.
!!
!! IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
!!
!! The evaluation procedure is written to short-circuit some potentially costly
!! calculations as directed by some optimization "hinting".  However, this
!! hinting is not currently exposed in the API for the user to control.  But
!! since we can directly interrogate SCAFUN objects to see if they are of the
!! constant flavor, we do set the optimization hinting for those functions at
!! least.
