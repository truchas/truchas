!! RAD_PROBLEM_GMV
!!
!! This is a quick-n-dirty high level layer over GMV's gmvwrite C library
!! that provides some procedures for writing a radiation enclosure surface
!! mesh and face-based fields over that mesh to a GMV-format graphics file.
!! It is intended for ad hoc use in standalone test programs and debugging
!! situations.

!! USAGE
!!
!!  This extends RAD_ENCL_GMV and RAD_SOLVER_GMV; refer to those modules for
!!  usage info, especially the former.  This module extends the following
!!  generic subroutines for RAD_PROBLEM type objects.
!!
!!  CALL GMV_WRITE_ENCLOSURE (THIS) writes the distributed radiation enclosure
!!    surface mesh contained within the RAD_PROBLEM type object THIS to the
!!    graphics file.  When executing in parallel, the partitioning of faces
!!    is written as flag data.
!!
!!  CALL GMV_WRITE_VARIABLE (THIS, VAR, NAME) writes the distributed variable
!!    data VAR to the graphics file.  THIS is a RAD_PROBLEM type object.
!!    VAR a face-based field defined on the associated heat conduction mesh
!!    and its value on the radiation enclosure surface mesh contained within
!!    THIS is extracted.  NAME is an arbitrary string used to label the
!!    variable; only the first 8 characters are significant.  This may be
!!    called multiple times.
