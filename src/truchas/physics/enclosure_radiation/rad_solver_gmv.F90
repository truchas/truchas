!! RAD_SOLVER_GMV
!!
!! This is a quick-n-dirty high level layer over GMV's gmvwrite C library
!! that provides some procedures for writing a radiation enclosure surface
!! mesh and face-based fields over that mesh to a GMV-format graphics file.
!! It is intended for ad hoc use in standalone test programs and debugging
!! situations.

!! USAGE
!!
!!  This extends RAD_ENCL_GMV; refer to that module for usage info.  This
!!  module extends the following generic subroutines for RAD_SOLVER type
!!  objects.
!!
!!  CALL GMV_WRITE_ENCLOSURE (THIS) writes the distributed radiation enclosure
!!    surface mesh contained within the RAD_SOLVER type object THIS to the
!!    graphics file.  When executing in parallel, the partitioning of faces
!!    is written as flag data.
!!
!!  CALL GMV_WRITE_VARIABLE (THIS, VAR, NAME) writes the distributed variable
!!    data VAR to the graphics file.  THIS is a RAD_SOLVER type object, and
!!    VAR a face field defined on the enclosure mesh contained within THIS.
!!    NAME is an arbitrary string used to label the variable; only the first
!!    8 characters are significant.  This may be called multiple times.
