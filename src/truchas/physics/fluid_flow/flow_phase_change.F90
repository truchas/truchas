!! This module implements functionality originally implemented in the
!! heat_transfer module.  It has been separated out here for two reasons:
!! it actually has little to do with heat transfer, and it is independent
!! of a particular heat transfer implementation, working for both old and
!! new heat transfer models.
!!
!! The Navier-Stokes update step (fluid_driver) needs to account for any
!! change in the amount of fluid material that has taken place between the
!! end of the mass advection step and the beginning of the Navier-Stokes
!! step.  Currently, any such change will be due to phase change that may
!! occur (implicitly) from the heat transfer step that is interposed between
!! the those two 'flow' steps.  This module provides the following methods
!! for communicating this info to the Navier-Stokes step:
!!
!!  CALL SET_REFERENCE_FLUID_DENSITY () should be called after the the mass
!!    advection step (advect_mass) and before the heat transfer step to set
!!    the reference value of the fluid density.
!!
!!  CALL SET_SOLIDIFIED_DENSITY () should be called after the heat transfer
!!    step and before the Navier-Stokes step (fluid_flow_driver).  This
!!    computes the density of fluid that has solidified since the call to
!!    SET_REFERENCE_FLUID_DENSITY.  This data is then available in the public
!!    module array SOLIDIFIED_RHO(:) for use by flow.  Note that the values
!!    are always non-negative; if the amount of fluid has increased (melting)
!!    the value is set to 0.
!!
!! If fluid flow is not enabled, both of these methods reduce to no-ops, and
!! so they may be called without worrying about what physics are enabled.
!!
!! The function HAVE_SOLIDIFYING_FLOW() returns true if SOLIDIFIED_RHO(:) has
!! been defined by a call to SET_SOLIDIFIED_DENSITY; any use of the array,
!! which may not be defined, should be protected inside if-blocks guarded by
!! the return value of this function.
