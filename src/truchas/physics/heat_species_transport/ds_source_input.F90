!! DS_SOURCE_INPUT
!!
!! This module provides procedures for reading the DS_SOURCE namelist and
!! for processing its data into a source mesh function object used by the
!! diffusion solver.

!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! The following routines read multiple instances of the DS_SOURCE namelist
!! from a file and process the data from selected instances to define SOURCE_MF
!! objects that define an external source function over the mesh.  The namelist
!! has the form
!!
!!    &DS_SOURCE
!!      EQUATION  = string
!!      CELL_SET_IDS = list-of-integers
!!      SOURCE_CONSTANT = real
!!      SOURCE_FUNCTION = string
!!    /
!!
!! Namelist selection is based on the value of the EQUATION string (case
!! insensitive).  The namelist arrays SOURCE_CONSTANT and SOURCE_FUNCTION
!! are used to specify the source: either a constant via SOURCE_CONSTANT
!! or the name of a known function (to the FUNCTION_TABLE module) via
!! SOURCE_FUNCTION, but not both.  The specified cell set IDs will be matched
!! to cell set IDs defined in the distributed mesh, and specify that part
!! of the domain where the source applies.  Different instances of the
!! namelist for a given EQUATION value must apply to disjoint parts of
!! the domain.
!!
!! Note that this module does not codify a particular set of equations.  The
!! using application code determines the equation names through its particular
!! use of DEFINE_EXTERNAL_SOURCE, and the input file data is expected to be
!! consistent with it.
!!
!! The following routines should be called once each, in the order presented.
!!
!!  CALL READ_DS_SOURCE (LUN) reads all the DS_SOURCE namelists from the file
!!    opened on logical unit LUN.  The actual reading of the file occurs only
!!    on the I/O process and the data is replicated on all other processes.
!!    If an error occurs (I/O error or invalid data) a message is written and
!!    execution is halted.  It is permissible for there to be no instance of
!!    the namelist.
!!
!!  CALL DEFINE_EXTERNAL_SOURCE (MESH, EQUATION, Q) initializes the SOURCE_MF
!!    type argument Q using data from the namelist instances whose EQUATION
!!    string match the value of the argument (case insensitive).  MESH is a
!!    pointer to the distributed mesh object over which the source is being
!!    defined.  If an error is encountered a message is written and execution
!!    is halted.  A 0-valued source is assigned to parts of the domain not
!!    referenced by one of the namelist instances.
!!
!! IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
!!
!! This is a two stage input implementation in keeping with Truchas' input
!! design.  All data is read and copied into memory in its raw (or lightly
!! processed) form, and then in a later stage accessed to perform the final
!! initialization of the code.  An alternative, and simpler, implementation
!! would directly read the input file for data as needed for initialization,
!! avoiding the creation of a temporary in-memory copy of the input file.
!!
!! To make this module as flexible as possible, it was decided not to codify
!! an explicit set of known equations. The downside is that it is not possible
!! to verify the input as thoroughly as could be done otherwise.  It is
!! possible to specify equation names that the application code will not use
!! without receiving any warning.  To help mitigate this issue, READ_DS_SOURCE
!! echos the specified equation for each namelist and calls to
!! DEFINE_EXTERNAL_SOURCE will echo the equation being accessed.  The user can
!! use this info to confirm what they supplied and what the application code
!! is using.
!!
!! The private module data is only intended to hold the raw input data
!! temporarily until it can be processed into SOURCE_MF objects and acquired
!! by the diffusion solver.  However this private data is never deallocated.
