!! SOURCE_MESH_FUNCTION
!!
!! Neil N. Carlson <nnc@lanl.gov>
!! Last revised 3 Apr 2009
!!
!! This module implements the derived type SOURCE_MF and associated evaluation
!! method SMF_EVAL that are required by the heat transfer/species diffusion
!! (HTSD) solver.  An instance of this type is intended to describe a time and
!! space-dependent external source term that has been discretized over the
!! cells of a distributed mesh.  Given the time value, the evaluation method
!! returns a cell-based array with the cell-averaged source values at that time.
!! This is the only method expected by the HTSD solver, which also treats
!! instances as opaque objects.
!!
!! This particular implementation supports sources that are the superposition
!! of an intrinsic heat source, arising from the explicit coupling of the HTSD
!! solver to other physics solvers, with an extrinsic user-specifed functional
!! source.  Examples of the former type of source are advected heat and Joule
!! heat; this type can be specfied as a cell-based array of source values.
!! The latter functional source can be specified in a piecewise manner: SCAFUN-
!! type functions associated to disjoint sets of cells described via mesh cell
!! set IDs.

!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!! The derived type SOURCE_MF is an opaque structure with private components.
!! No defined assignment is provided; do not use instances of this type in an
!! assignment statement unless you really know what the default assignment is
!! doing (it's almost certainly not what you want).  The extrinsic functional
!! source term is defined by an initial call to SMF_PREP, zero or more calls
!! to SMF_ADD_FUNCTION and an optional call to SMF_SET_DEFAULT, and a final
!! call to SMF_DONE.  This definition is mandatory.  At this stage the object
!! may be evaluated with SMF_EVAL.  Also at any time after this stage the
!! instrinsic source may be set using SMF_SET_EXTRA_SOURCE as often as needed;
!! the specified value will be incorporated into the result returned by
!! subsequent calls to SMF_EVAL.  This definition is optional.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_PREP (THIS, MESH) prepares the SOURCE_MF object THIS to begin
!!    receiving the data associated with one or more source functions.  MESH
!!    is a pointer to the distributed mesh object over which the source is to
!!    be discretized.  The implementation assumes that the mesh cell data will
!!    never be modified.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_ADD_FUNCTION (THIS, F, SETID, STAT, ERRMSG) associates the SCAFUN
!!    function object F to the cell sets with IDs given in the rank-1 integer
!!    array SETID.  The possible cell sets are those defined in MESH.  This
!!    function object should expect (/ t, x, y, z /) as the array argument.
!!    An independent copy of F is stored so that the actual argument may be
!!    destroyed afterwards if desired.  A nonzero value is assigned to the
!!    integer STAT if an error condition occurs, and an explanatory message
!!    is assigned to the character string ERRMSG. Possible errors are referring
!!    to an invalid cell set ID or attempting to associate a cell to more than
!!    one function.  This routine may be called multiple times (or even not at
!!    all), as long as the specified cell sets do not overlap from one call to
!!    the next.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_SET_DEFAULT (THIS, DEFAULT) sets the default source value to
!!    DEFAULT.  This value will be used for any cell that is not associated
!!    to a function.  Calling this routine is optional.  If no default value
!!    is set, then every cell must be associated to a function.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_DONE (THIS, STAT, ERRMSG) performs the final configuration of the
!!    SOURCE_MF object THIS after all the desired calls to SMF_ADD_FUNCTION
!!    and SMF_ADD_DEFAULT have been made.  A nonzero value is assigned to the
!!    integer STAT if an error condition occurs, and an explanatory error
!!    message is assigned to the character string ERRMSG.  It is an error for
!!    a cell to be without a function if no default value was set.  After this
!!    call the object THIS may be evaluated using SMF_EVAL.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_SET_EXTRA_SOURCE (THIS, Q) sets the optional intrinsic source term
!!    to the value of the cell-based array Q.  The value will be incorportated
!!    into the result returned by subsequent calls to SMF_EVAL. This subroutine
!!    may be called as needed.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_EVAL (THIS, T, Q) evaluates the SOURCE_MF object THIS at time T
!!    and returns the computed source values in the cell-based array Q.  The
!!    returned value is the sum of the source specified by SMF_SET_EXTRA_SOURCE,
!!    if any, and the cell-averaged source functions.  A simple 1-point (cell-
!!    centroid) quadrature is currently used.
!!
!!  CALL SMF_DESTROY (THIS) frees the resources associated with the SOURCE_MF
!!    object THIS, returning it to its default initialization state.
!!
!! IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
!!
!! The evaluation procedure is written to short-circuit some potentially costly
!! calculations as directed by some optimization "hinting".  However, this
!! hinting is not currently exposed in the API for the user to control.  But
!! since we can directly interrogate SCAFUN objects to see if they are of the
!! constant flavor, we do set the optimization hinting for those functions at
!! least.
