!! This module provides procedures for performing the mapping of cell-based
!! fields between the EM tet mesh and the main Truchas hex mesh.  This is a
!! thin layer over GRID_MAPPING_MODULE where all the real work is performed.

 !! GET_GRID_MAPPING_DATA
 !!
 !! The subroutine returns the grid mapping data GMD required to map data
 !! between the main Truchas mesh HEXMESH and the EM mesh TETMESH.  It attempts
 !! to read this data from the file specified in the ALTMESH namelist.  If that
 !! isn't successful it has the mapping data computed and written to the file
 !! for use in future runs.  This is a serial subroutine and should only be
 !! called from the IO processor.

 !! MAP_HEX_FIELD
 !!
 !! Maps the distributed, cell-based array HEX_FIELD on the main hex mesh to
 !! the distributed, cell-based array TET_FIELD on the EM tet mesh.  The
 !! mapping is constant-preserving and strict, and DEFVAL specifies the value
 !! to use for tets that do not intersect the hex mesh (see the documentation
 !! for GRID_MAPPING_MODULE).  It is assumed that the grid mapping data GMD was
 !! calculated with the hex mesh as MESH_A and the tet mesh as MESH_B (on the
 !! IO processor only.)  This is a parallel subroutine.

 !! MAP_TET_FIELD
 !!
 !! Maps the distributed, cell-based array TET_FIELD on the EM tet mesh to

 !! for hexes that do not intersect the tet mesh (see the documentation for

 !! calculated with the hex mesh as MESH_A and the tet mesh as MESH_B (on the

 !! MAP_CELL_FIELD_AUX
 !!
 !! This auxillary subroutine is a parallel wrapper around the serial
 !! MAP_CELL_FIELD procedure from the GRID_MAPPING_MODULE module.  The
 !! distributed source field is collated, mapped in serial, and the collated
 !! result distributed to the destination field.  Two forms of the mapping
 !! are possible: FORM=1  is the constant-preserving hex-to-tet mapping,
 !! and FORM=2 is the conservative tet-to-hex mapping.  It is assumed that
 !! the grid mapping data GMD was generated with the hex mesh as MESH_A and
 !! the tet mesh as MESH_B
