  !! This routine computes the H-field at a point due to current flow in a
  !! cylindrical, z-axial, n-turn coil centered at the origin.  The coil is
  !! approximated by an array of coaxial current loops centered at equi-spaced
  !! points along the z-axis from z=-a to z=a.  The result assumes a unit
  !! current in each loop that flows ccw with respect to coil's axis; the
  !! H-field is linear in the current.  If n is negative, the result corresponds
  !! to a |n|-turn coil with a cw flowing current.  If n=0, the result is a
  !! zero vector.

  !! This routine computes the H-field at a point due to a circular current
  !! loop in the x/y-plane centered at the origin.  The result assumes a
  !! unit current flowing ccw; to obtain the result for a current J, simply
  !! multiply the result by J.
  !!
  !! NB: The general expression is indeterminate on the loop axis (divide by
  !! zero).  The routine makes a half-assed effort to remove this numerical
  !! singularity by using the analytic limiting expression for points exactly
  !! on the axis.  We really ought to be using a series expansion for points
  !! near the axis, with a smooth transition between the two expressions.
