!! PHYSICAL_CONSTANTS
!!
!! This module provides physical constants used by various physics modules.
!! These are fixed constants whose value depend on the particular system of
!! units being used.  The following constants are provided and, by default,
!! have been assigned their SI unit values.

!!  STEFAN_BOLTZMANN -- the Stefan-Boltzmann constant that appears in thermal
!!    radiation models.
!!  ABSOLUTE_ZERO -- the value of absolute zero in the temperature scale; used
!!    in thermal radiation models.
!!  VACUUM_PERMITTIVITY, VACUUM_PERMEABILITY -- the electric permittivity and
!!    magnetic permeability of free space; used by the electromagnetic solver.
!!
!! The following subroutine is provided to overwrite the default values with
!! user-specified values read from an input file.
!!
!!  CALL READ_PHYSICAL_CONSTANTS (LUN) reads the above variables from the
!!    first occurrence of the physical_constants namelist in the file opened
!!    on logical unit LUN.  If the namelist is not found no action is taken.
!!    Any variable not specified in the namelist retains its default value.
!!
!! Note to maintainers:  These constants should be considered read-only, and
!! their values should only be defined by methods provided by this module.
!! Please adhere to this policy when adding new constants.
