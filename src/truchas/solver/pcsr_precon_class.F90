!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!!  This module defines the abstract base class PCSR_PRECON which defines a
!!  common interface to preconditioners for PCSR_MATRIX-type matrices.
!!  Application code is expected to use polymorphic variables of this type
!!  and not work directly with extensions of the type.  The base type defines
!!  The following type bound procedures
!!
!!  INIT(A, PARAMS) configures the object to be a preconditioner for the
!!    specified PCSR_MATRIX A.  The object holds a reference to the matrix A,
!!    and so the matrix must not go out of scope during the lifetime of the
!!    object.  Moreover, the actual argument must be a pointer or have the
!!    target attribute.  Only the structure of the matrix needs to be defined
!!    at this point; the matrix values are not referenced.  Also note that
!!    matrix will not be modified in any way by this, or any other procedure.
!!    The PARAMETER_LIST object PARAMS gives the parameters associated with
!!    the preconditioner; its expected content will depend on the dynamic
!!    type of the PCSR_PRECON object (see the comments for the extended types.)
!!
!!  COMPUTE() performs the final setup and configuration of the preconditioner.
!!    It is at this point that the values of the PCSR_MATRIX A are referenced.
!!    This must be called before calling the APPLY procedure and after the
!!    matrix values are defined, and must be called again whenever the matrix
!!    values are modified.
!!
!!  APPLY(X) applies the preconditioner to the vector X.  The size of X must
!!    be at least A%NROW; only the initial A%NROW elements will be referenced
!!    or modified.
!!
!!  MATRIX() returns a pointer to the PCSR_MATRIX object A with which the
!!    preconditioner was configured in the INIT call.
