!! USTRUC_COMP_FACTORY
!!
!! This module provides a parameter list-driven procedure for instantiating a
!! USTRUC_COMP object that encapsulates the low level microstructure modeling.

!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!!  NEW_USTRUC_COMP(N, PARAMS) returns a pointer to a new CLASS(USTRUC_COMP)
!!    object carries out the microstructure analysis. N is the number of points
!!    where the analysis will be applied, and PARAMS is a parameter list that
!!    contains the specification of the analysis to be done.
!!
!!  The parameters that are understood are documented in the source files for
!!  the concrete implementations of the USTRUC_PLUGIN class.  Currently, these
!!  are USTRUC_VEL1, USTRUC_TIME, and USTRUC_GV0.
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  1. This is a work in progress.  The present implementation is a minimal
!!  stand-in that merely enables all the analysis components, drawing data
!!  from a flat shared parameter list.  A more flexible implementation that
!!  allows for a finer grained control is planned (through a hierarchical
!!  parameter list, for example), but this will probably need to wait until
!!  the input file format is upgraded.
!!
!!  2. As currently implemented, the USTRUC_OBJECT cannot be instantiated until
!!  the number of points N is known.  Yet the specification of the analysis
!!  components is completely orthogonal to the size of the internal state
!!  arrays (N).  This coupling is undesirable and these two concepts ought
!!  to be separated if possible (FIXME).
