!! This module provides some utilities that are useful in reading input files:
!!
!!    CALL SEEK_TO_NAMELIST (UNIT, NML, FOUND [, IOSTAT]) seeks to the next
!!      record in the file connect to UNIT that contains the start of a namelist
!!      data group for the namelist named NML.  This is a record whose first
!!      nonblank is an '&' followed without an intervening blank by the name of
!!      the namelist.  Searching starts from the current file position, and if
!!      such a record is found, the file is left positioned at that record and
!!      FOUND is set to true; otherwise FOUND is set to false.  The search is
!!      not case-sensitive.  If an I/O error occurs, the nonzero I/O error code
!!      is returned in IOSTAT if it is present, otherwise an error message is
!!      written to stderr and the program is halted.
!!
!!      Note that the file connected to UNIT must be capable of being backspaced
!!      which is not the case, for example, when reading from the tty.

 !! SEEK_TO_NAMELIST
 !!
 !! This subroutine seeks to the next record in the file connected to UNIT
 !! that contains the start of a namelist data group for the namelist named
 !! NML.  This is a record whose first nonblank is an '&' followed (without
 !! an intervening blank) by the name of the namelist.  Searching starts from
 !! the current position, and if such a record is found, the file is left
 !! positioned at that record and FOUND is set to true; otherwise FOUND is
 !! set to false.  The search is not case sensitive.
 !!
 !! Implementation Note
 !!
 !! o If searching for the namelist 'foo', we need to be sure that we don't
 !!   mistakenly match '& foo' or '&foobar', thus we do a formatted read of
 !!   a string one character longer than the namelist name.  A matching
 !!   input string will be right delimited with a blank or EOR, and in the
 !!   later case the string read will be right padded with a blank.  Thus
 !!   this will not interfere with the string comparison.
