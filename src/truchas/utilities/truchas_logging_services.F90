!! PROGRAMMING INTERFACE
!!
!!  There are three categories of log messages. Informational messages are the
!!  typical generic messages, written as-is without any adornment.  These are
!!  logged using TLS_INFO.  Warning messages are intended to warn the user of
!!  a possible non-fatal error or exceptional condition.  These are written
!!  prefixed with "Warning:" to be readily distinguished from other messages.
!!  These are logged using TLS_WARN.  The final category is fatal error
!!  messages, and these are logged using either TLS_FATAL or TLS_ERROR.  The
!!  former prefixes the message with "FATAL:" and gracefully terminates
!!  execution.  The latter prefixes the message with "ERROR:" but does not
!!  terminate execution.  However in this case it is required that execution
!!  ultimately be terminated using TLS_FATAL.  The intent is to permit the
!!  logging of multiple fatal errors before finally terminating execution.
!!
!!  Informational messages are subdivided into several verbosity levels.
!!  Only those messages not exceeding the system verbosity level are logged.
!!  The verbosity levels are provided by the named module constants
!!  TLS_VERB_SILENT, TLS_VERB_NORMAL, and TLS_VERB_NOISY.  The module variable
!!  TLS_VERBOSITY (read-only!) gives the system verbosity level.  These values
!!  are of a private derived-type, and thus are only useful for passing to the
!!  procedures described below (the VERBOSITY argument), or in a comparison
!!  expression like "if (TLS_VERBOSITY >= TLS_VERB_NOISY) ..."  All of the
!!  comparison operators are defined for the type.
!!
!!  The procedures TLS_INFO, TLS_WARN, TLS_ERROR, TLS_FATAL should be regarded
!!  as collective procedures, needing to be invoked by every parallel process.
!!  In reality only TLS_FATAL is truly collective (to terminate execution.)
!!  Logging is done by the designated I/O process only, using the message on
!!  that process; other processes do nothing, except when terminating execution
!!  with TLS_FATAL.
!!
!!  Because logging a fatal error message is a collective operation, it is
!!  often required to communicate the presence of an error condition on one
!!  process across the entire parallel machine so that it can be properly
!!  logged.  The convenience procedures TLS_FATAL_IF_ANY, TLS_FATAL_IF_IOP
!!  which wrap TLS_FATAL, handles this communication.
!!
!!  Finally, there are occasions when it is not possible or convenient to
!!  gracefully terminate execution in a collective manner.  The procedure
!!  TLS_PANIC exists for this purpose.  It can be called by one or more
!!  processes, and each writes its message prefixed with "PANIC[N]:" to the
!!  terminal (only), where N is the process rank, and then execution is
!!  terminated via MPI_ABORT, which is supposed to terminate all processes,
!!  including those not calling TLS_PANIC.  There may be issues with losing
!!  some output.  Use of this procedure should be kept to a minimum.
!!
!!  As currently implemented, messages are logged to both the terminal (C's
!!  stdout or Fortran's output_unit) and to the *.log file in the run's
!!  output directory.  TLS_PANIC messages are written only to the terminal.
!!
!!  What follows is a more detailed description of the procedures.  Note
!!  that some variants allow an array MESSAGE which is handled as a multiline
!!  message.  This is mostly for compatability with existing Truchas usage;
!!  new use of multiline messages is discouraged.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_INFO (MESSAGE[, VERBOSITY]) writes the message passed in the
!!    character argument MESSAGE, which may be either a scalar or a rank-1
!!    array.  In the latter case each array element is written starting on
!!    a new line.  VERBOSITY specifies the verbosity level of the message,
!!    and defaults to TLS_VERB_NORMAL.  If the message verbosity level exceeds
!!    the system verbosity level (TLS_VERBOSITY) the message is not written.
!!    For clarity this should be called collectively, but only the designated
!!    I/O process logs its message.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_INFO (MESSAGE, ADVANCE[, VERBOSITY]) writes the message passed
!!    in the scalar character argument MESSAGE.  If the logical argument
!!    ADVANCE is false, the usual trailing newline is not written, otherwise
!!    the behavior is exactly as for the first variant of TLS_INFO.  Note
!!    that this variant is not defined for array MESSAGE.  VERBOSITY specifies
!!    the verbosity level of the message and defaults to TLS_VERB_NORMAL.
!!    If the message verbosity level exceeds the system verbosity level
!!    (TLS_VERBOSITY) the message is not written.
!!    For clarity this should be called collectively, but only the designated
!!    I/O process logs its message.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_WARN (MESSAGE) writes the warning message passed in the character
!!    argument MESSAGE, which may be either scalar or a rank-1 array.  The
!!    written message is prefixed with the string "Warning: ".  When MESSAGE
!!    is an array, the second and subsequent lines are indented so that the
!!    message appears as a block to the right of the "Warning: " prefix.
!!    For clarity this should be called collectively, but only the designated
!!    I/O process logs its message.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_ERROR (MESSAGE) writes the error message passed in the character
!!    argument MESSAGE, which may be either scalar or a rank-1 array.  The
!!    written message is prefixed with the string "ERROR: ".  When MESSAGE
!!    is an array, the second and subsequent lines are indented so that the
!!    message appears as a block to the right of the "ERROR: " prefix.  This
!!    procedure does not initiate termination of the simulation, however,
!!    the caller is expected to ultimately do so using TLS_FATAL.
!!    For clarity this should be called collectively, but only the designated
!!    I/O process logs its message.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_FATAL (MESSAGE) writes the error message passed in the scalar
!!    character argument MESSAGE.  The written message is prefixed with the
!!    string "FATAL: ".  After logging the message the parallel machine is
!!    brought down (MPI_FINALIZE) and execution gracefully terminated.  This
!!    is a collective procedure.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_FATAL_IF_ANY (ERRC, MESSAGE) calls TLS_FATAL with the passed
!!    message if the logical argument ERRC has value true on any of the
!!    processes.  This is a collective procedure.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_FATAL_IF_IOP (ERRC, MESSAGE) calls TLS_FATAL with the passed
!!    message if the logical argument ERRC has value true on the IO process;
!!    ERRC is ignored on other processes.  This is a collective procedure.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_PANIC (MESSAGE) writes the message passed in the scalar character
!!    argument MESSAGE to the terminal, prefixed with the string "PANIC[X]: ",
!!    where X is the rank of the process.  This is not a collective procedure;
!!    any number of processes may call it and each process writes its own
!!    message.  After writing the message execution is ungracefully terminated
!!    via MPI_ABORT.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_EXIT logs the fixed normal termination message (no passed message)
!!    and the parallel machine is brought down (MPI_FINALIZE) and execution
!!    gracefully terminated.  This is a collective procedure.
!!
!!  Packages that handle their own logging (e.g. Ubik) often accept a unit
!!  number to use for that purpose.  The function TLS_LOGGING_UNIT() returns
!!  a unit number used by this module for logging (on the I/O process, -1 on
!!  all other processes.  Currently this is the unit for the .log file.
!!  [This use case argues for logging to a single device, and not several.]
!!
!!  The following procedures initialize and finalize the logging system.  They
!!  are called by the Truchas driver, and should never be invoked by normal
!!  application code.
!!
!!    CALL TLS_INITIALIZE
!!    CALL TLS_SET_VERBOSITY (VERBOSITY) sets the system verbosity level.
!!    CALL TLS_FINALIZE
!!
!!  The following procedure is provided for use in ad hoc debugging only.
!!  Use when needed, but then remove it -- DO NOT LEAVE IT IN THE CODE.
!!
!!  CALL TLS_DEBUG (MESSAGE) writes the input scalar character MESSAGE to a
!!    processor-specific file.  The file is named debug.<N>, where <N> is the
!!    process rank, and it is created in the directory from which the
!!    executable was run.  After each write the output buffer is flushed.
!!    The file is created only if needed.  This is NOT a collective procedure.
!!
!! IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
!!
!! * I've continued the tradition of logging to both the terminal (stdout) and
!!   the .log file. We should revisit this choice of two output devices at some
!!   point. It would be simpler to limit to a single device, terminal or disk
!!   file.
!!
!! * I would like the routines that terminate execution to return a status
!!   code to the OS (via the system exit command, for example).  This would
!!   make it trivial for shell scripts to know whether a run was successful
!!   or not.  This isn't fully possible for the following reasons:
!!   = Serial.  PGSLIB_Abort invokes STOP.  PGSLIB_Finalize is a no-op and
!!     returns control, so there at least exit could be called.
!!   = Open MPI (1.5).  MPI_Finalize returns control and exit can be called,
!!     but it is mpirun that receives the status code, not the OS, and mpirun
!!     does not itself return the status code.  All it does is write useless
!!     info to stderr.  The situation is effectively the same for MPI_Abort,
!!     though it's not clear that it returns control to the caller.
!!   As a consequence, I'm not bothering with calling exit at this time.
!!
!! POSSIBLE TO-DOS
!! * Create debug files in output file directory along with everything else.
!! * option to suppress warning messages
!! * pass the is_IOP flag into initialization and eliminate dependence on
!!   parallel_communication module.
!! * flushing of the output buffers.
