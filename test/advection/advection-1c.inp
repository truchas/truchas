TWO-FLUID 2D ADVECTION
-----------------------
Advection in a two-fluid 2D domain with planar interface orthogonal to
velocity. Velocity is uniform and constant and directed along a coordinate
axis. Domain is 31x31x3 with unit cells. Volume fractions should be
advected exactly.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated velocity)
