TWO-FLUID 2D ADVECTION WITH TET CELLS
-------------------------------------
Advection in a two-fluid 2D domain with planar interface orthogonal to
velocity. Velocity is uniform and constant and directed along a coordinate
axis. Domain is 15x15x1 with unit cells subdivided into 6 tets each.
Volume fractions should be advected exactly.
