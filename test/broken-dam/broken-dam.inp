Liquid Columns on a Rigid Horizontal Plane," Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society of London, Series A, Vol. 244, pp. 312-324, 1952.

Column of fluid is initially at rest, falls under gravity and flows
along the bottom surface of the mesh (50 x 22), towards an open
boundary at the right edge.  Of interest is the shape of the free
surface, and the position of the leading edge of the collapsing
column, as a function of time.

Martin & Moyce provide the following data for the position of the
leading edge:

   t* == t*sqrt(2.*9.81/.05715)
   x* == x/.05715, where x is the position of the leading edge, and
                      .05715 is the initial width of the column

To run the problem out to t* > 4, set Output_T = 0.0, 0.25.

For the purposes of having this problem in the test suite, we limit
the cycles (cycle_max = 20), and perform a restart from a calculation
that terminated after 140 cycles.  At this time, we don't use the 
data by Martin & Moyce for this regression test.
