Errata for contact_box_open.pdf (NNC, May 2012)
-----------------------------------------------

* Equation (12) is incorrect.  The correct matrix is the transpose.
  Rotating about y is viewed as rotation in the (z,x) plane (note
  the order!) and not the (x,z) plane.

* Equation (13) must be changed as a result (there was a sign error
  there even if (12) were correct).  Should be a + on the (1,3) and
  (2,1) elements.  The (3,1) element should have a - (as it did).
