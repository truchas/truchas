DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 10

Test of internal HTC conditions.  2D heat conduction in [-0.5,0.5]^2
with a piecewise linear steady state solution that should be recovered
exactly (at t=infinity).  Internal interfaces along coordinate axes.
The x < 0 and y > 0 part of the interface are set up as gap elements
using the addgaps utility.  The remaining part is created here.  A
different HTC coefficient is used on {x=0} than on {y=0}.  A unit
outward heat flux is imposed on the left and bottom boundaries and a
unit inward heat flux is imposed on the top and right boundaries.
Initial conditions are a uniform temperature of 3, and the average
temperature should remain at that value.  The exact solution in the
four quadrants of the domain are

   T = x + y + 2.7  |  T = x + y + 3.5
  ------------------+------------------
   T = x + y + 2.5  |  T = x + y + 3.3
