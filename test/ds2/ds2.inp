DIFFUSION SOLVER TEST 2

Nonlinear heat conduction.  2D domain, 1 cell thick.  Imposed flux at left
end of rectangular domain, Dirichlet condition at the other end, and no flux
on the remaining boundaries.  Low-conductivity inclusion in the middle of
the domain created using a 'cylindrical' body, giving rise to mixed-material
cells.

This is essentially the same problem as the species diffusion TEST 1, only
expressed in terms of temperature rather than concentration; the solutions
should be identical, and the enthalpy 1/4 of the temperature.

Input file is written to allow running the same problem using the existing
HT/PC solver.  Just turn on heat conduction and turn off the diffusion solver
in the PHYSICS namelist.  Note that the mesh is non-orthogonal (a jittered
orthogonal mesh) and that LSLR discrete operator seems to have problems with
it and/or the boundary conditions so ortho operators are used for HT/PC.
