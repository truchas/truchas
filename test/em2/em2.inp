1D AXISYMMETRIC INDUCTION HEATING WITH TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT EM PARAMETERS

Cylindrical conductor in a uniform, alternating magnetic field.  Domain is
one quarter of a thin cross-sectional slab, surrounded by some free-space.
The EM permeability and conductivity are temperature dependent.  The hex mesh
does not include any free space region.  The tet mesh conforms to the hex
mesh in the conductor, being obtained by subdivision of the hex cells.
