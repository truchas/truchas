2D AXISYMMETRIC INDUCTION HEATING TEST PROBLEM

Origin-centered ball surrounded free space in a z-axial cylindrical domain.
Symmetry is exploited by considering only the positive octant.  Driven by an
alternating, z-axial magnetic field produced by a 2-turn induction coil.
Hex mesh does not include any free-space region.  The tet and hex meshes in
the ball are not conforming.
