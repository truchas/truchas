INVISCID FLUID DRAINING FROM A PIPE WITH VOID
---------------------------------------------
This is simple 1D inviscid fluid/void flow problem. The 2D 5x1 pipe domain is
filled with fluid except for a bit of void at the right end. There is a velocity
BC of -1 at the left outlet boundary, and a compatible initial fluid velocity
of -1. Fluid gradually drains from the pipe with the fluid/void interface moving
with speed -1. The simulation ends before the pipe is completely drained of fluid.
 
We should recover the exact solution: P=0, V=(-1,0,0) on cells with
fluid, with the fluid/void interface moving at speed 1 to the left.
