INVISCID FLUID PLUG ACCELERATING DOWN PIPE WITH VOID
----------------------------------------------------
This is a simple 1D inviscid fluid/void flow problem. The 3d 5x1x1 pipe domain is
void except for a plug of fluid near the left end but bordered by void on either
side. The fluid is subject to a gravity force directed down the pipe. It begins
with an initial velocity of 0 and accelerates to the right. At the final time
t=3 the plug should be near the right end (centered at x=1.5) and moving with
velocity 2.

This problem uses a regular Cartesian mesh whose node positions have been
perturbed by 10% of the edge length (and is therefore a non-orthogonal mesh).

We should recover the exact solution for pressure and velocity: P=0,
V=(1,0,0)*(2*t/3) on cells with fluid. The exact position of the fluid/void
interface should be x = -1 + t**2 / 3. We don't recover this exactly because
of the explicit advection scheme, but we use an unusually small courant number
here to reduce the error.
