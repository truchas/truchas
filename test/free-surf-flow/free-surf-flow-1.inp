INVISCID FLUID FILLING A PIPE WITH VOID
---------------------------------------
This is simple 1D inviscid fluid/void flow problem. The 2D 5x1 pipe domain is
void except for a bit of fluid at the left end. There is a velocity BC of 1 at
the left inlet boundary, and a compatible initial fluid velocity of 1. Fluid
gradually fills the pipe with the fluid/void interface moving with speed 1.
The simulation ends before the pipe is completely filled with fluid.

We should recover the exact solution: P=0, V=(1,0,0) on cells with
fluid, with the fluid/void interface moving at speed 1 to the right.
