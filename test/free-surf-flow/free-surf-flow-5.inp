INVISCID FLUID PLUG TRAVELLING DOWN PIPE WITH VOID
--------------------------------------------------
This is a simple 1D inviscid fluid/void flow problem. The 2d 5x1 pipe domain is
void except for a plug of fluid near the left end but bordered by void on either
side. The fluid has an initial velocity of 1. The fluid plug should move down
the pipe with speed 1. The simulation ends before the plug reaches the right end.

We should recover the exact solution: P=0, V=(1,0,0) on cells with fluid, with
the fluid/void interfaces moving at speed 1 to the right.
