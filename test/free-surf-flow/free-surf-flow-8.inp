INVISCID FLUID FILLING A PIPE WITH VOID
---------------------------------------
This is simple 1D inviscid fluid/void flow problem. The 2D 5x1 pipe domain is
void on the right and fluid on the left.. There is a pressure BC of -10 at the
left boundary, and an initial fluid velocity of 0.5. Fluid initially moves to
the right, then is sucked out the left boundary.

This test is made to ensure no velocity or pressure is introduced in void cells,
particularly as a result of the pressure gradient at the fluid/void interface.
