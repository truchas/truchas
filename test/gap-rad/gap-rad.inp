GAP RADIATION TEST 1 (GAP-RAD)
------------------------------
1D heat conduction on [-1,1] with an internal interface at x=0, where a gap
radiation interface condition is imposed.  No heat flux at either end.  The
initial temperature is ~1.5 on the left and ~0.5 on the right.  This problem
has an approximate analytic solution in the form of a 2-term asymptotic
expansion in powers of 1/k, where k=100 is the thermal conductivity.  This
test exercises interface condition implemented in the 'HTSD' solver; the
associated gap-rad-flow test exercises the implementation in the 'FHT' solver.

In order to hit the final time exactly we are using a fixed step size.
Towards the end this is much smaller than BDF2 would want and the nonlinear
solver 'converges' in a single iteration (just a FP iteration -- not good).
In order to force more iterations we have set nlk_tol much smaller than
one would use under normal circumstances (0.1-0.01).  Note that the solver
will exit after the first iteration only when the error is 100 times smaller
than this.  Without this hack the final error is larger than it should be
because of the accumulation of local errors over many steps due to the
nonlinear system not being solved accurately enough at late times.
