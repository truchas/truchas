HTVOID4 -- Flow with void and view factor radiation

Another off-the-wall test that exercises the free surface flow-coupled
heat tranfer solver.  The focus here is on the coupling to view factor
radiation.  The domain is a 1D flow channel thermally coupled to wall
bodies above and below the channel.  In this case the walls are thick
and each contain a radiation cavity, which are totally separate from
the flow.  The walls are split in half length-wise with a 0-HTC condition
that makes radiation the only means of heat transfer between the two
pieces.  The simulation begins with the channel filled with fluid moving
to the right, and a vertical thermal gradient.  Void enters at the left
end and the fluid exits the right end with a fixed unit velocity.  A right-
directed gravity is included to help maintain a flat fluid/void interface.
The simulation ends before all the fluid has exited the domain.

NOTE: The flow itself is very sensitive to the various flow parameters.
Small changes to things -- initial step size, for example -- will lead to
different flow solutions with bits of fluid left behind or not.  The flow
solution is largely correct, but the differences in which cells are void
will result in heat solutions that are not comparable.
