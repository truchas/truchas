HTVOID4 -- Flow with void and view factor radiation

Another off-the-wall test that exercises the free surface flow-coupled
heat tranfer solver.  The focus here is on the coupling to view factor
radiation.  The domain is a 1D flow channel thermally coupled to wall
bodies above and below the channel.  In this case the walls are thick
and each contain a radiation cavity, which are totally separate from
the flow.  The walls are split in half length-wise with a 0-HTC condition
that makes radiation the only means of heat transfer between the two
pieces.  The simulation begins with the channel filled with fluid moving
to the right, and a vertical thermal gradient.  Void enters at the left
end and the fluid exits the right end with a fixed unit velocity.
