INFLOW INTO A VOID-FILLED PIPE
------------------------------
A simple 1D inviscid pipe flow problem. Here the pipe is entirely void
initially and fluid is introduced at the left end starting at t=0. The
sole purpose of this test is to verify that we can specify an inflow
material. The domain is [-0.375,0.375] x [-0.5,0.5] x [-0.5,0.5] with
regular cells of size 0.25. The inlet velocity is 0.25 and we run until
t=1.5 which should put the fluid/void interface at x=0 at the midpoint
of the middle layer of cells. NB: if the problem is evolved longer,
the solution will go south when the interface passes into the final layer
of cells on the right as the algorithm is currently unable to collapse
void there.
