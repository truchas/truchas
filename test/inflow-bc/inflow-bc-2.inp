INFLOW INTO A VOID-FILLED PIPE WITH HEAT TRANSPORT
--------------------------------------------------
This is an extension of the inflow-bc-1 test that adds heat transport.
The sole purpose of this test is to verify that we can specify the temperature
of the inflow material. The default treatment of the material inflowing through
the boundary is to assume its temperature is that of the receiving cell. Here
the domain is entirely void with no temperature (or 0), so we must specify the
temperature of the inflow material explicitly.

This test uses the FHT solver for heat transport
