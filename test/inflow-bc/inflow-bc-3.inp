INVISCID PIPE FLOW WITH DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE FOR INFLOW MATERIAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Steady inviscid flow through a pipe with heat transfer. The initial fluid
temperature is 1 but the temperature of the inflowing material is 2. The
sole purpose of this test is to verify that the inflowing material has the
prescribed temperature, and not the temperature of the receiving cell, which
is the default behavior. This problem runs out to a long time, so that the
initial material has been flushed out many times, and the temperature should
be very nearly uniform at the inflow temperature.

This test uses the HTSD solver for heat transport
