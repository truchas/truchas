This is a very coarse version of the deVahl-Davis benchmark problem of natural
convection in a 2D square cavity.  This version uses a tet mesh.  See the hex
version for more documentation about the benchmark problem.  For the purposes
of regression testing we do not compare with the highly-resolved reference
data (necessarily using a loose tolerance), but with archived golden data for
the coarse problem using a very tight tolerance.
