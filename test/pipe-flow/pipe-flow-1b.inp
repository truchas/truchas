2D PIPE FLOW
------------
Simple viscous flow through a 2D pipe of length L. Constant pressure p1 at one
end, p2 at the other. No-slip BC along the walls of the pipe. Extend uniformly
in the z direction (3 cells thick) with free-slip BC on the z=const boundaries.
Solution is symmetric across the mid-plane of the pipe, so solve in one half
only with free-slip BC on the symmetry plane.

At steady state the axial velocity U is a function of the coordinate across the
width of the pipe, with U'' = (p2-p1)/(2*mu*L).

If width of the pipe is 2, -1 <= y <= 1, p1 = 3, p2 = 0, mu = 3, L = 1, then
U(y) = (1 - y^2)/2, and maximum axial velocity along axis is 1/2.
