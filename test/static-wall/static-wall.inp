STATIC WALL TEST
----------------
Fluid-filled disk carved out of immobile wall material.  2D regular mesh.
Some cells contain both fluid and wall material.  Initial velocity is zero
and we have a body force.  Fluid should remain at rest.  Simulation takes
one step, and the velocities should be examined.

This regression test is motivated by [artf26905] which describes a bug
in compute_gravityhead reported by Joris Verschaeve (joris.verschaeve@gmail.com)
(University researcher in Oslo, Norway) that affected the "body force face"
method for computing body forces.  Before the fix the maximum velocity
magnitude was 0.023, and after it was less than 3e-12.
