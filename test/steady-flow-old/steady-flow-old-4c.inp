STEADY INVISCID 2-MATERIAL FLOW
-------------------------------
2D rectangular domain (1 cell thick in z) with steady uniform flow directed
along the x-axis. Prescribed inflow velocity on the left and dirichlet pressure
on the right. Two equal-density fluids with planar interface oblique to the
x-axis. Constant initial velocity field consistent with the BC. Velocity should
remain constant. Interface will not be exactly advected due to approximation
errors from Young's method for computing the interface normal adjacent to the
boundary.

This problem is analogous to a pure advection problem, except that instead
of a prescribed constant velocity, we solve for the velocity, expecting to
recovery that constant velocity.

Variations use rotated meshes (and rotated velocity)
