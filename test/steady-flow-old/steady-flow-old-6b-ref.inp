STEADY INVISCID 3-MATERIAL FLOW
-------------------------------
Steady inviscid flow in a 2D square domain (1 cell thick in z) with uniform flow
directed diagonally across the mesh. Prescribed inflow velocity on the left and
bottom sides, and dirichlet pressure on the right and top (outflow) sides. One
fluid occupies half a disk, another the other half, and a third fluid the
complement. Fluid density ratio is 100. Constant initial velocity field consistent
with the BC. Velocity should remain constant.

This problem is analogous to a pure advection problem, except that instead
of a prescribed constant velocity, we solve for the velocity, expecting to
recovery that constant velocity.
