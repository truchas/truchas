VIEW FACTOR RADIATION TEST 2
----------------------------

Solid ball radiating to a cooler spherical shell.  In this simulation the ball
is centered, but the radiation enclosure view factors were computed using a
mesh where the ball was shifted off-center.  The ENCLOSURE_RADIATION namelist
variable Skip_Geometry_Check=.true. allows the simulation to proceed.  The
resulting temperature profile should be identical to that from the simulation
with the off-center ball that actually matches the view factors.
