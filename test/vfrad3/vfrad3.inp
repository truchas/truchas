VIEW FACTOR RADIATION TEST 3

3D heat conduction and view factor radiation in a casting-like configuration
with an outer shell mold and inner core mold (not connected) separated by a
meshed void region (the casting cavity).  There is an interface between core
and cavity and shell and cavity, with a dummy 0-HTC condition, and enclosure
view factor radiation in the cavity, which is the sole means of heating the
core.
